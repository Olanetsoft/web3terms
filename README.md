## üîÄ Connecting to Twitter

1. Register a Twitter account and also get its "app info".
>Twitter doesn't allow you to register multiple twitter accounts on the same email address. I recommend you create a brand new email address (perhaps using Gmail) for the Twitter account. Once you register the account to that email address, wait for the confirmation email.

2. Now go [here](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new) and log in as the Twitter account for your bot:
3. Fill up the form and submit.
4. Next once the submission completes you will be taken to a page which has the 
+ "Settings" tab : Update details here
+ "Permissons" tab :  Enable `Read and Write` 
+ "Key and Access Token" tab : Click on `Generate access token`. 
5. Create a `.env` file and fill in the generated tokens in the "Key and Access Token" tab.
It should look like this:
PORT=xxxx
NODE_ENV=development

DEV_BASE_URL=http://localhost:$PORT
PROD_BASE_URL=http://localhost:$PORT

TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=xxxx
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=xxxx

TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxx
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=xxxx
            
6. Type the following in the command line in your project directory to start the project

```bash
yarn dev
```

You should have something similar to what is shown below on your terminal.

```javascript
[LOGGING] info: "Connected!"
[LOGGING] info: "Server running on port xxxx"
```
